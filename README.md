# TIME MONKEY 

## Epitech Jam

This game was made during the Epitech Jam between the 12th and the 14th of Febuary 2021

## Tech used

Time Monkey was made using LÃ–VE, a lua 2d game framework. It use classic, an Object library by rxi and bump, a collision library by kikito
We wanted to implement timer based mechanics using tick by rxi, but we didn't had the time to do it

For this game we wrote a pseudo ECS. We didn't had time for proper component implementation

The game engine we made support time travel mechanics between maps
